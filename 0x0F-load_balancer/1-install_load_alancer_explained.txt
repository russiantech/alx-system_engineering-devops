explain this file again `1-install_load_balancer`

Certainly! Let's go through the contents of the 1-install_load_balancer file step by step:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
This line is called a shebang. It indicates that the file is a Bash script, and it should be interpreted and executed by the Bash shell.

bash
Copy code
# Update the package list
sudo apt-get update
This line updates the package list on the server using the apt-get package manager. It ensures that the system has the latest information about available packages.

bash
Copy code
# Install HAProxy
sudo apt-get install -y haproxy
Here, the script installs HAProxy using apt-get. The -y flag is used to automatically confirm and install the package without asking for user confirmation.

bash
Copy code
# Configure HAProxy
sudo tee /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg > /dev/null <<EOL
This line uses the tee command to write the HAProxy configuration to the file /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg. The <<EOL is a heredoc (here document) syntax, allowing the script to include a block of text until it encounters EOL. This block of text is the configuration for HAProxy.

bash
Copy code
frontend web_frontend
    bind *:80
    mode http
    default_backend web_servers

backend web_servers
    mode http
    balance roundrobin
    #Note: "257290" is my Student-Id
    server web-01 257290-web-01:80 check
    server web-02 257290-web-02:80 check
EOL
This is the actual configuration for HAProxy. It defines a frontend (web_frontend) that listens on port 80 and directs traffic to a backend (web_servers). The backend uses the round-robin algorithm to distribute requests between web-01 and web-02 servers.

bash
Copy code
# Restart HAProxy to apply changes
#sudo systemctl restart haproxy
sudo service haproxy restart
These lines restart HAProxy to apply the new configuration. The script uses service to restart HAProxy.

bash
Copy code
# Enable HAProxy to start on boot
#sudo systemctl enable haproxy
sudo service haproxy enable
These lines enable HAProxy to start automatically when the system boots up. They use service to enable the HAProxy service.

In summary, the script installs HAProxy, configures it to load balance between two servers, and ensures that HAProxy starts on boot. You can execute this script on your target server to set up HAProxy with the specified configuration.

But what exactly I'm I supposed to insert here:

    server web-01 257290-web-01:80 check
    server web-02 257290-web-02:80 check

In the context of HAProxy configuration, the lines:

bash
Copy code
server web-01 257290-web-01:80 check
server web-02 257290-web-02:80 check
are specifying the backend servers that HAProxy will balance traffic between. Let me break down the syntax:

server web-01: This is a label or name for the server. You can replace "web-01" with any identifier you prefer.

257290-web-01:80: This is the address of the server. The format is hostname_or_IP:port. Replace "257290-web-01" with the actual hostname or IP address of your first web server. :80 specifies that the server is running on port 80.

check: This option tells HAProxy to regularly check the health of the server. If a server fails health checks, HAProxy will stop sending traffic to it until it recovers.

For your specific case, where you have servers with the following information:

257290-web-01: ubuntu user and IP 100.25.119.84
257290-web-02: ubuntu user and IP 54.197.113.176
You would replace the lines with:

bash
Copy code
server web-01 100.25.119.84:80 check
server web-02 54.197.113.176:80 check
This assumes that your web servers are configured to accept traffic on port 80. Adjust the IP addresses and port numbers if your actual setup is different.

sudo ufw default deny incoming # deny * incoming connections

sudo ufw default allow outgoing # allow * incoming connections

sudo ufw allow 22/tcp # allow * incoming connections on port 22 (SSH)(default TCP port and ssh). The `/tcp` makes it more strcitier
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp # allow * incoming connections on port 443 (HTTPS SSL). The `/tcp` makes it more strcitier
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp #80 (HTTP)
sudo ufw  #Firewall is active and enabled on system startup

#edit `/etc/ufw/before.rules` to add port forwarding before the *filter option

#enable ipv4 port forwarding by editing `vi /etc/sysctl.conf` and uncomment that ipv4 line.

Now reload that config file by running `sudo sysctl -p`


#FOR TASK 2. Almost similar. Just a copy of the configured file

[200~To achieve port forwarding on web-01 using UFW, you need to create or modify the UFW configuration file. In this case, you'll copy the modified UFW configuration file to 100-port_forwarding. Below is an example of how you can do this:

Open the UFW configuration file for editing:
bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/ufw/before.rules
Add the following lines to forward traffic from port 8080 to port 80. Place these lines before the COMMIT line:
plaintext
Copy code
# Port Forwarding
*nat
:PREROUTING ACCEPT [0:0]
-A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 8080 -j REDIRECT --to-port 80
COMMIT
Save the changes and exit the editor.

Verify the UFW configuration:

bash
Copy code
sudo ufw status
Ensure that the configuration reflects the changes you made.

Save the UFW configuration to a new file:
bash
Copy code
sudo cp /etc/ufw/before.rules 100-port_forwarding
Now, the contents of 100-port_forwarding should include the port forwarding rules.

Below is an example entry for your answer file:

# Answer for Task: Port Forwarding

1. Open the UFW configuration file for editing:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/ufw/before.rules
Add the following lines to forward traffic from port 8080 to port 80:

plaintext
Copy code
# Port Forwarding
*nat
:PREROUTING ACCEPT [0:0]
-A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 8080 -j REDIRECT --to-port 80
COMMIT
Save the changes and exit the editor.

Verify the UFW configuration:

bash
Copy code
sudo ufw status
Save the UFW configuration to a new file:

bash
Copy code
sudo cp /etc/ufw/before.rules 100-port_forwarding
vbnet
Copy code

After creating the `100-port_forwarding` file, it can be used to configure the firewall on `web-01` by copying it and then running `ufw enable` to apply the changes.
